# Access-Form-Project
AccessForm is a web-based survey builder designed with accessibility as the highest priority. Unlike common survey tools, it ensures that people with disabilities—including those with visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive challenges—can easily create and participate in surveys. The system supports multiple ways to respond, including through the web, voice commands, and SMS, making it widely accessible.

The project focuses on following official accessibility guidelines like WCAG 2.1 and WAI-ARIA to provide an inclusive experience for all users. It features an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for building surveys, various question types, and accessibility enhancements such as keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and high-contrast themes.

Technologies used in this project include modern web development frameworks and tools that support both frontend and backend functionalities, along with accessibility testing utilities to ensure compliance. The goal of AccessForm is to create an easy-to-use, fully accessible survey platform that promotes equal participation for everyone.
